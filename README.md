actix-gcd
=========

actix-gcd is a simple Rust project that uses the Actix framework to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers. It provides a web interface where you can enter two numbers and get their GCD.

Installation
------------

To run this project, you'll need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can download Rust from the official website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Once you have Rust installed, you can clone the project from GitHub:

`git clone https://github.com/Niqrs/actix-gcd.git`

Usage
-----

To run the project, use the following command:

`cargo run`

This will start the Actix server and listen for incoming requests on `http://localhost:3000`.

To use the web interface, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a simple HTML page with two text fields and a button. Enter two numbers in the text fields and click the "Compute GCD" button to calculate the greatest common divisor of the two numbers.
